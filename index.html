            Hurling, often described as "the fastest game on grass," is known for its high speed, skill, and physicality. Players use a wooden stick called a hurley to hit a small ball called a sliotar, aiming to score points by sending the ball through the opponent's goalposts. The sport demands not only physical prowess but also tactical intelligence and teamwork.
            </p>

Hurling is more than just a sport; it is a symbol of Irish culture and heritage, celebrated by millions both in Ireland and around the world. The passion and commitment of hurling players and fans alike make it truly the greatest sport on earth.
